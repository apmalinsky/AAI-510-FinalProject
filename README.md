# AAI-510-FinalProject
For health insurance companies, wellness programs, and preventive care providers, early identification of individuals at high risk of developing chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease) allows for proactive intervention. This translates to reduced healthcare costs, improved patient outcomes, and a better quality of life for individuals, moving from reactive "sick care" to proactive "health care." For this problem, we will focus on diabetes.

Diabetes is a growing health concern that affects million of people worldwide. Not treating this disease may lead to further complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, etc. Early detection is important because it gives people the ability to change their lifestyle or start treatment prior to the disease worsening.

This project aims to build two predictive models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) that classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using health and demographic indicators from a public dataset. We used logistic regression as a baseline starting point to understand how individual features relate to diabetes risk. Then, we used Random Forest as it handles non-linear relationships, outliers, and imbalanced data well. These types of classification models are useful for better health outcomes as well as reducing the burden on the healthcare system.

To run the project, we recommend running the notebook in Google Colab.
